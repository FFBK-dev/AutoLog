# FileMaker Backend System - User Guide

*A simple explanation of what's running behind the scenes for your FileMaker database*

---

## What is this system?

This is an **automation system** that works with your FileMaker database to process photos and videos automatically. Think of it like having a smart assistant that can:

- Analyze your images and videos
- Generate descriptions using AI
- Extract technical information
- Keep everything organized in your FileMaker database

## What is an API?

An **API** (Application Programming Interface) is like a digital messenger. It's the way this automation system "talks" to your FileMaker database. 

**Here's how it works:**
- The system connects securely to your FileMaker database
- It can read information from your records
- It can update records with new information
- It processes items automatically when they're ready

Think of it like having a very efficient digital assistant that never sleeps and can process hundreds of items perfectly every time.
