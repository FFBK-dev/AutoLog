Only use \"Aerial\" for very high altitude shots from aircraft/helicopters that appear significantly elevated above the landscape. Do NOT use \"aerial\" for regular elevated angles or standard drone shots.\n\nConsider how much of the frame the main subject(s) occupy versus the surrounding environment when determining shot type.\n\nUse this information for context:\n- Metadata: {INFO_Metadata}",
